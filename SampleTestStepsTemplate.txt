(Sample Intro about your ticket) This ticket is about building star rating pane needs which need to build for the sticky price mini panel on holiday and accommodation product pages. However, the pane will be available for all type of products to use.

* (Some background) This ticket adds background image on product pages, background image are drupal image files tagged with tag like backgroundimage-<tag>. You can access drupal image files at http://acquiastage.travel-associates.com.au/admin/content/file
* (Step) Product page background image follows below logic and hierarchy:
** (Sub-step) If image with backgroundimage-<destination> exists then this file should be used as background image.
** (Sub-step) If image with backgroundimage-<coutnry> exists then this file should be used as background image.
** (Sub-step) If image with backgroundimage-<continent> exists then this file should be used as background image.
** (Sub-step) If image with backgroundimage-<category> exists then this file should be used as background image.
** (Sub-step) If no images available with above tag then default black world map should be used as background image on all products except cruise products. On cruise products if no images available with above tag then no image should be displayed.
